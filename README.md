* **Linux:** Install `build-essential` (Ubuntu/Debian) or the equivalent package group for your distribution.

### 🛠️ Compilation

1. Open your terminal or command prompt.
2. Navigate to the directory where you saved your `.cpp` file (e.g., `main.cpp`).
3. Run the following command to compile the code:

```bash
g++ main.cpp -o hello_world
